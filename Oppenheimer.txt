Sure, here are some famous phrases said by Oppenheimer:

"Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."
"We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita: Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that, one way or another."
"Any man whose errors take ten years to correct is quite a man."
"The optimist thinks this is the best of all possible worlds. The pessimist fears it is true."
"There must be no barriers to freedom of inquiry. There is no place for dogma in science. The scientist is free, and must be free to ask any question, to doubt any assertion, to seek for any evidence, to correct any errors."


"The only thing that stands between us and chaos is the thin rind of our reason."
"Science is a great engine of discovery, but it is not a moral compass."
"The world is not a wish-fulfilling machine."
"The pursuit of knowledge is one of the greatest gifts that we can give ourselves and to the world."
"The atomic bomb has taught us how to live with the prospect of annihilation, but it has not taught us how to live without war."
